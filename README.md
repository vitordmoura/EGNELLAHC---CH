# Challenge - HC - ICR

FIAP (Faculdade de Informática e Administração /Paulista) and HC (Hospital das Clínicas) 
joined in the challenge of improving the care experience within the hospital, both for companions and patients.

Our role is to provide an experience for patients and their companions, 
we know that procedural operations and compliance with protocols in a hospital environment is not an easy task and requires humanization
of all stages of this complex process, from the scheduling of an exam, its preparation, its and even the waiting environment.
